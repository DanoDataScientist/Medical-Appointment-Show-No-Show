# Medical-Appointment-Show-No-Show
 A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame?  What is a no-show? Basically, it’s a non-attending person who neither uses nor cancels their reservation. A missed appointment seems like an everyday, a normal thing. It’s not something we like when it happens to us, but it just, well, happens. The problem is, people have no idea of the scale of this problem. Recent surveys such as one below have concluded that as many as 42% of patients skip their appointments. http://www.annfammed.org/content/2/6/541.full At the end of these surveys (each using different data for analysis), various reason came up for these no shows- poor medical literacy, anxiety, transportation barrier and sometimes simply forgetting. All this results in doctors losing their valuable time, and it’s not just about time, a surgeon may lose up to 500$ per missed visit, so the problem is significant.   One way doctors/clinics/hospitals can make people remember about their appointments is by reminder calls and SMS notification but sometimes even that won’t do. So there’s scope of study/analysis into this problem.  Aim here was to use some of the tricks learned in the Statistical Data Mining class and do some predictive analytics based on some factors in the dataset, with a goal to find out interesting relationships which hint at whether or not the patient will end up visiting the clinic.
